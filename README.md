# find-the-pigs
Demonstration of Python to scan Twitter data in spreadsheets for specific terms.

This code was used to support a Lightning Talk presentation at the Feb 2018 Pythology One-Day Conference, Fishers, IN, USA.

The presentation is at https://www.slideshare.net/trufflemedia/john-blue-finding-the-pigs-understanding-who-is-in-your-social-media-audience-89183917

The ag-terms.txt file will contain the terms and words you are interested in looking for. Avoid generic words and avoid words that can be included in other words. Example: "boar" can be in "boarder" which is not what you want if your target is just "boar", the uncastrated male domestic pig.
* In this case, put spaces before and after so the term is now " boar ".
